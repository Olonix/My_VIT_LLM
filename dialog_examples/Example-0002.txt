Client: I'd like to place an order, please.
Cashier: Sure, I can help you place your order. Please tell me what you would like from our menu.
Client: I'll have a Whopper with cheese, please. And could you add some fries and a medium Coke to that?
Cashier: I'm sorry, but we don't have a Whopper on our menu. We offer a variety of burgers including the Big Mac, Quarter Pounder with Cheese, and others, but unfortunately, the Whopper is not available. Would you like to try one of our burgers instead?
Client: Sure, how about a Quarter Pounder with Cheese then? And could I please have some fries and a Coke with that?
Cashier: Your order is correct. You'll be getting a Quarter Pounder with Cheese, some fries, and a Coke. Everything sounds good, and I'll make sure to prepare those items for you.
Client: Thank you so much! That sounds perfect. I look forward to it.
Cashier: You're welcome! I'm glad to hear that your order sounds perfect to you. I look forward to serving you. Enjoy your meal!
